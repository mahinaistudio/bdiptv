# BD IPTV

BD IPTV allows users to stream Bangladeshi TV channels online using an M3U playlist with any IPTV player.

Many free M3U links available on the internet stop working because they are not maintained regularly. Development of many such repositories has been discontinued, so no support or updates should be expected. However, since this source is open, anyone can fork the repository and manage it independently.

The playlist can be used with various IPTV players on Windows, Android, iOS, Apple TV, and Android TV.
